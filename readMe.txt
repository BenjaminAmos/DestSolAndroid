This is an IDEA project for building Destination Sol android app & html5 version. Html version is buggy and slow and abandoned. So it's still here just in case.

How to build an Android app:
1) copy DS "res" folder into "android/assets"
2) copy sol.jar into "android/libs"
3) maybe update app version in AndroidManifest
3) build app with IDEA

How to build HTML app:
I don't remember :D The thing is, IDEA was able to build js code, but couldn't assemble the final artifact, so I've manually created "artifactTemplate", and was updating js in that template to have an app.
